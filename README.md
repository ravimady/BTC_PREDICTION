This project is a personal project to develop a Machine Learning process in continuously understanding the factors that influence the Bitcoin prices and be able to accurately predict the movement in Bitcoin and later even other coins. To start with, I had identified a list of features that I thought may be most influential in its movements like gold price, stock indices and dollar value. For this project, I had preprocessed about 300 days of historcal data (flexible to change as it was done through an API call). Since it is a time series data it makes sense to also derive some features such as day, day of the week (mon-fri),day of the month etc. Further, I had also created other features like price_lags, meaning how does yesterdays price influence days price.
